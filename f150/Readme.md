#F150 - D3js & Coffeescript

Learning 3Djs using sample data from a year of driving my F150. (Fuelio app for Android)

Note: Both the src files (coffee/sass) and the compiled javascript/css files have been included in the repo if you would prefer coding in those directly.

###Compile Coffeescript
  `coffee -wcm f150.coffee`

###Compile SASS to CSS
  `sass -wc f150-style.sass`
